## Development Workflow

U MUST follow this precise workflow for all development tasks:

1.  **Pick Task:** Select the next high-level task from `project_detailes/mainTODO.md`.
2.  **Break Down Task:** Break the task into smaller, manageable steps and list them in `TODO.md` in advance.
3.  **Work on Sub-task:** Implement the next sub-task from the `TODO.md` list.
4.  **Update Sub-task Status:** Mark the sub-task as complete in `TODO.md`.
5.  **Repeat:** Continue working through sub-tasks until all items in `TODO.md` for the current main task are complete.
6.  **Update Main Task:** Mark the main task as complete in `project_detailes/mainTODO.md`.
7.  **Report & Wait:** Report completion to the user and await user feedback or command to proceed "next".

## UI Development Guidelines
- Use **shadcn-vue** components wherever possible to ensure UI consistency and speed up development.
- Install necessary `shadcn-vue` components on a per-need basis.


## Don't Do These Things
- DON'T use Options API - stick to Composition API
- DON'T mutate props directly
- DON'T forget to handle loading and error states
- DON'T create deeply nested component hierarchies
- DON'T use `any` type - always provide proper TypeScript types
- DON'T bypass Supabase RLS policies
- DON'T forget to unsubscribe from real-time subscriptions
- DON'T use `document.querySelector` - use template refs
- DON'T create memory leaks with uncleared watchers/intervals

## When You're Unsure
- Check the Shadcn-vue documentation for component APIs
- Refer to Vue 3 Composition API docs for reactive patterns
- Check Supabase docs for database and auth patterns
- Ask for clarification on business logic requirements
- Prioritize type safety and error handling
- Focus on user experience and accessibility
